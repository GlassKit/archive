<p>Follow these guidelines when referring to the Glass name or brand.</p>
<p>See the <a href="../design/style.html">Style</a> section to see how to create Glassware that coincides with the Glass look and feel.</p>
<h2 id="glass-icons-and-assets">Glass icons and assets</h2>
<h3 id="for-properties-not-related-to-glassware">For properties not related to Glassware</h3>
<p>Do not use, modify, or mimic any proprietary Glass icons or assets for your properties. Examples include, but are not limited to, physical merchandise, promotional materials, third party brands, and product reviews. If you have to refer to the Glass brand, do so only with text in line with the <a href="#glass_in_text">Glass in text</a> guidelines.</p>
<h3 id="for-glassware-or-glassware-related-properties">For Glassware or Glassware-related properties</h3>
<p>For Glassware and its related web and mobile properties, you can use the resources provided on <a href="../tools-downloads/downloads">Assets</a>, unmodified, to properly create and promote Glassware.</p>
<p>Do not use these Glass icons and assets for any other purpose, for example, in physical merchandise that is related to your approved Glassware or in non-approved Glassware. If you have to refer to the Glass brand in other situations, do so only in text in line with the <a href="#glass_in_text">Glass in text</a> guidelines.</p>
<h2 id="glass-in-text">Glass in text</h2>
<p>These guidelines apply to all text that refers to the Glass name and brand.</p>
