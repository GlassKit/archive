<h1 id="voice-command-checklist">Voice Command Checklist</h1>
<p>Glass voice commands are carefully tuned and designed for the best accuracy and recognition. This means they take quite a bit of time for us to model and develop.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve come up with the following guidelines to help us more quickly evaluate and build your voice commands. You should follow the guidelines or have a good reason to break them.</p>
