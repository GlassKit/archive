<h1 id="platform-overview">Platform Overview</h1>
<p>When developing Glassware, the best practice is to develop with the Glass Development Kit. This allows you to access low-level hardware features and create robust experiences in a familiar Android environment.</p>
<p>We recommend you read the <a href="patterns/">design patterns</a> guide. They'll help you design your Glassware and go over best practices that will help you build quickly.</p>
<h2 id="the-glass-development-kit">The Glass Development Kit</h2>
<p>The Glass Development Kit (GDK) is an add-on to the Android SDK that lets you build Glassware that runs directly on Glass. Use the GDK to take advantage of the following features:</p>

<p>Real-time User Interaction</p>
<img src="../static/offline.png" alt="">
<p>Offline Functionality</p>
<img src="../static/hardware.png" alt="">
<p>Access to Hardware</p>
<p>By using the Android SDK and GDK, you can leverage the vast array of Android APIs and also design a great experience for Glass.</p>

<h3 id="work-in-the-android-environment">Work in the Android environment</h3>
<p>We designed the Glass platform to make the existing Android SDK just work on Glass. This lets you code in a familiar environment, but for a uniquely novel device.</p>
<p>In addition, you can use all of the existing Android development tools, and your Glassware is even delivered as a standard Android package (APK).</p>

<h2 id="the-mirror-api">The Mirror API</h2>
<p>This RESTful API lets you build Glassware by letting you use the language of your choice and providing web-based APIs. You may want to use the Mirror API if you need:</p>

<h2 id="hybrid-glassware">Hybrid Glassware</h2>
<p>Mirror API Glassware can invoke GDK Glassware through a menu item. You can use this hybrid model to leverage existing web properties that can launch fuller experiences that run directly on Glass.</p>
