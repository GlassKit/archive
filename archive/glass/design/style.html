<h1 id="style">Style</h1>
<p>Glass has a unique style, so we provide standard card templates, a color pallete, typography, and writing guidelines for you to follow whenever possible.</p>
<p>Before designing any custom layouts, use the available <a href="https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/card-design#layouts">CardBuilder Layouts</a> [<strong>TODO</strong>: ADD LINK] provided by the GDK to give users a consistent user experience. If none of these layouts meet your requirements, follow the guidelines below in your design.</p>
<h2 id="metrics-and-grids">Metrics and Grids</h2>
<p>The Glass user interface has standard layout and margin guidelines for different types of timeline cards. Cards normally have the following general regions, and we&#8217;ve laid out some guidelines for you to follow for a general set of cards.</p>
<h3 id="card-regions">Card regions</h3>
<p>Glass defines dimensions for a set of common regions to make it easy to design and display different cards consistently.</p>
<p><img src="static/standard-template.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Main Content
The main text content of the card is in Roboto Light with a minimum size of 32 pixels and is bounded by padding. Text that is 64 pixels and larger uses Roboto Thin.</p>
<p>Footer
The footer shows supplementary information about the card, such as the source of the card or a timestamp. Footer text is 24 pixels, Roboto Regular, and white (#ffffff) in color.</p>
<p>Full-bleed image
Images work best when full-bleed and do not require the 40px of padding that text requires.</p>
<p>Left image or column
Left image or columns require modifications to padding and text content.</p>
<p>Padding
Timeline cards have 40 pixels of padding on all sides for the text content. This allows most people to see your content clearly.</p>
<h2 id="layout-templates">Layout templates</h2>
<p>The GDK provides various <a href="https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/card-design#layouts">CardBuilder Layouts</a> [<strong>TODO</strong>: ADD LINK] that you can use.</p>
<h2 id="color">Color</h2>
<p>Glass displays most text in white and uses the following standard colors to denote urgency or importance. You can make use of these colors for your timeline cards as well:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>CSS Class</th>
<th>RGB Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>white</td>
<td>#ffffff</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>gray</td>
<td>#808080</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>blue</td>
<td>#34a7ff</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>red</td>
<td>#cc3333</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>green</td>
<td>#99cc33</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>yellow</td>
<td>#ddbb11</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: if you apply these CSS styles to your HTML timeline cards, Glass renders them automatically with the correct color. Glass uses the <a href="static/base_style.css">base_style.css</a> file to render HTML cards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following example uses colors to denote important information about train lines and status.</p>

<h2 id="typography">Typography</h2>
<p>Glass displays all system text in Roboto Light, Roboto Regular, or Roboto Thin depending on font size. If you&#8217;re creating live cards or immersions, feel free to use different typography to convey your own branding.</p>
<h3 id="roboto-light">Roboto Light</h3>
<p>Glass displays most text in this font.</p>

<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:</strong> this is not actually Roboto Light. If for some reason you happen to want it very badly, <a href="https://github.com/glasskit/website/pulls">submit a pull request</a>.</p>

<p>When using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/card-design#text_and_text_fixed"><code>CardBuilder.TEXT</code></a> [<strong>TODO</strong>: ADD LINK] and <a href="https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/card-design#columns_and_columns_fixed"><code>CardBuilder.COLUMNS</code></a> [<strong>TODO</strong>: ADD LINK] layouts, Glass uses the largest font size possible based on the amount of content. The following cards show examples of the typography characteristics of text based on the amount of text.</p>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>You have limited space for text, so follow these guidelines when writing text for Glassware.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it brief</strong>. Be concise, simple and precise. Look for alternatives to long text such as reading the content aloud, showing images or video, or removing features.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it simple</strong>. Pretend you&#8217;re speaking to someone who&#8217;s smart and competent, but doesn&#8217;t know technical jargon and may not speak English very well. Use short words, active verbs, and common nouns.</p>
<p><strong>Be friendly</strong>. Use contractions. Talk directly to the reader using second person (&#8220;you&#8221;). If your text doesn&#8217;t read the way you&#8217;d say it in casual conversation, it&#8217;s probably not the way you should write it.</p>
<p><strong>Put the most important thing first</strong>. The first two words (around 11 characters, including spaces) should include at least a taste of the most important information in the string. If they don&#8217;t, start over. Describe only what&#8217;s necessary, and no more. Don&#8217;t try to explain subtle differences. They will be lost on most users.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid repetition</strong>. If a significant term gets repeated within a screen or block of text, find a way to use it just once.</p>
